<h3> Here's how the CherryTree works:</h3>

YOU:
<br>  
<ul>
    <li>Choose goals for your child to focus on daily. Use suggested goals from our child development professionals, or create your own.

    <li>Assign fun activities for your child to do on the CherryTree.

    <li>Select rewards for your child to work towards. Use our direct link to Amazon to make shopping easy.   
</ul>

<br>
<br>
YOUR CHILD:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Logs in each day to report progress on goals and earn cherries.

    <li>Completes assigned activities to earn more cherries.

    <li>When enough cherries have been earned, unlock rewards!
</ul>
