<h2>Everything You Need To Know About:</h2>
<h1>SELF-CONTROL</h1>
<p>
	Self-control is a skill that enables a child to suppress inappropriate and undesirable behaviors, and act in a socially acceptable manner.  Practicing self-control allows children the ability to make a decision about how to behave, and choose a suitable course of action.  Individuals are not born with self-control; it is an acquired skill.
</p>
<p>
	Children normally learn self-control as they progress from kindergarten through high school. Knowing when to sit, when to walk, when to speak, when to keep silent, and how to deal with conflict are a big part of maturation. For some children these lessons come early and easily. Many children learn self-control by watching their peers and practicing their observations. They are often eager to behave well and earn the approval of parents, teachers, and other kids.  However, there are a significant number of children who do not learn self-control through observation.  They need direct intervention and instruction from parents and teachers, often with the use of rewards and consequences.

<h2>Teaching Self-Control</h2>

<p>
	If planned intervention is necessary to teach a child self-control, it is important that parents and instructors select goals for him or her that are age-appropriate.  Discuss the goals with the child to engage their cooperation.  Encourage him or her to join you in a project that will improve behavior in a specific way. Try one simple goal at first, where the probability of success is high. Other goals can be added after the first is accomplished.  For example, a goal for a six-year-old child would be to stay seated or to raise his hand to speak.  An eight-year-old’s goal could be to stay out of fights and not talk while others are speaking.  Listening to directions and ignoring peers' teasing would be appropriate goals to set for a ten-year-old child.

<p> <b>Teacher and Parent Strategies:</b>
	As soon as behavioral goals are made, a strategy for teaching self-control should be selected. Some classroom management ideas that help children develop a sense of control are listed below, and most of these can be transferred to the home setting as well:
</p>
<ol>

	<li> <b>Use prompts.</b>
		Seat the child near the front of the class where prompting can be carried out unobtrusively and without embarrassing the child; remind the child of the new goal by using a pre-arranged signal — a hand signal or a touch on the shoulder.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Use positive reinforcement.</b>
		The key to success is in reinforcing the child consistently for progress and behavioral accomplishments. Discussing reinforcement with the student beforehand can be effective.  Attention and praise are the most important reinforcements. Other possible reinforcements might be an extra privilege in the classroom, or a small reward (i.e., an extra story at bedtime, a sticker, a fun activity) at home.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Frequently review progress with the child.</b>
		Acknowledge the child’s accomplishments and address goals that need further work. Let the child know how he or she doing.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Practice parent/teacher collaboration and cooperation.</b>
		Parents and teachers need to work together to find common goals and to discuss the child’s accomplishments and failures.  Similar strategies and positive reinforcements should be agreed upon and used in both the classroom and at home.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Reduce distractions.</b>
		Keep manipulative objects away from a child who is working on a goal unless he or she needs them for a specific learning activity.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Help students make transitions.</b>
		Follow a stimulating activity with a quiet one (like looking through a book or drawing, for example) to help children learn how to shift gears.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Use flexible work spaces.</b>
		Some children may work better on the floor than at a desk, for example.  Perhaps your child can focus on a book better when he or she is sitting at the kitchen table rather than on the couch.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Teach attention skills.</b>
		A child can be taught to fold hands together or put them in pockets when quiet attention is needed.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Contracts.</b>
		Use contracts to specify desired behavior, and be diligent about holding the child responsible for following the contract.  Look for sample contracts in the CherryTree resource center.
	</li>

	<p>
		<b>Self-Regulation:</b>
		Once the child has experienced some success in achieving self- control by using these teacher/parent-conducted strategies, a self-regulation program can be implemented. However, self-regula¬tion should be used only when other self-control objectives have been achieved, and only if the child shows interest in changing his or her behavior more independently. The steps are the same for the self-regulation process (gaining the child's cooperation through discussion with teachers/parents, goal selection, strategy selection, and a reinforcement plan, which also requires the adult participation).
