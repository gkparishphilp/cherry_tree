<h2>Everything You Need To Know About:</h2>
<h1>ATTENTION PROBLEMS</h1>
<p>
	There are several attention problems that can affect children throughout their development.  When children are <b>hyperactive</b>
	, easily <b>distracted</b>
	, or tend to have impulsive behavior, it is very difficult for them to focus and feel at ease in their own skin. This causes them to seek attention by acting out.  There are several steps a parent can take in order to help their child succeed, gain self-confidence, and have positive behavior.
</p>

<h2>Hyperactivity</h2>

<p>
	<b>External Structure:</b>
	Providing an external structure for your child is extremely important to combat hyperactivity.  This structure is built with both physical controls and predictability.
</p>

<p>
	The
	<b>physical controls</b>
	that offer structure and stability include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A sufficient amount of sleep, a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and medication if necessary.
	</li>
	<li>
		Determine a schedule that suits your child.  For example, mornings are usually best for learning, a calm nightly routine helps prepare a child for bedtime.  Realize that children have trouble cooperating when they are hungry or tired.
	</li>
	<li>
		Make sure that a child’s environment is safe, and remove delicate or treasured items to help prevent problems and accidents. 
Predictability also provides stability by:
	</li>
	<li>Using consistent rules and boundaries across time and place.</li>
	<li>
		Preparing your child for change before switching to a new activity.
	</li>
	<li>Implementing simple daily routines.</li>
	<li>Having regular contact with your child’s teacher.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Distractibility</h2>

<p>
	<b>Focus on Priorities:</b>
	Preparing your child by focusing on priorities will help minimize distractions.  Also, giving them directions will help them feel more stable and less overwhelmed.
</p>

<p>
	Examples of some
	<b>priorities</b>
	include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Organizing your child’s backpack and notebook the night before school.
	</li>
	<li>
		Making education a priority and limiting extra-curricular activities.
	</li>
	<li>
		Clearly communicating and repeating your expectations. This will encourage good behavior and keep your child focused.
	</li>
	<p>
		Give
		<b>directions</b>
		to minimize distractions:
	</p>
	<li>
		Use simple, positive directions by showing what to do instead of what not to do.
	</li>
	<li>
		Provide visual clues such as a goals list to help your child stay on task.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impulsivity</h2>
<p>
	<b>Build Self-Confidence:</b>
	Impulsive behavior is more manageable when a child has high self-esteem.  Self- confidence can be elevated when a child learns skills that make them comfortable in a social setting.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Social Skills</b>
	can be taught and encouraged by parents:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Build on a child’s strengths and highlight natural abilities.
	</li>
	<li>
		Help by teaching your child game-playing skills, stressing the importance of taking turns and making good choices.
	</li>
	<li>Encourage noncompetitive sports (karate, running, swimming).</li>
	<li>
		Teach friendship skills (asking questions, giving compliments, sharing).
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	When managing impulsive children, it is important to implement strategies that reduce this attention-seeking behavior.  Model positive self-talk, demonstrate control over emotions, and set goals for yourself and your child.  Have specific times for bonding with your child and focus solely on him or her in a setting that has few distractions.  Offer rewards for positive behavior whenever necessary.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to a child’s impulsive behavior, parents need support, as well.  Some suggestions are to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Enroll in classes about behavior management</li>
	<li>Join support groups with other parents</li>
</ul>
