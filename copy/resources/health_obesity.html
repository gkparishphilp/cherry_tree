<h2>Everything You Need To Know About:</h2>
<h1>CHILDHOOD OBESITY</h1>
<p>
	Obesity is defined as an excessive accumulation of body fat. How much fat is "excessive" depends on the weight and height of the individual. Between 5&#37;-25&#37; of children and adolescents in the United States are obese. During the past twenty years, studies have shown an alarming increase of obese children in the United States. Not all obese infants become obese children, and not all obese children become obese adults. However, the prevalence of obesity increases with age among both males and females and it is more likely that obese teenagers will be become obese adults.

<h3>The Causes of Childhood Obesity:</h3>
<p>
	Obesity in children most likely results from an interaction of nutritional, familial, physiological, and psychological factors. The risk of becoming obese is greatest among children who have obese parents. Although the role of genetic factors in childhood obesity remains controversial, parental modeling of both diet and exercise behaviors affects the children.  A lack of activity is a significant source of obesity in children, and as they get older their activity levels usually decrease further.

<h3>The Impact of Obesity on a Child’s Well-Being:</h3>
<p>
	Obesity presents numerous problems for children. It takes a toll on a child’s psychosocial adjustment as well as on his or her physical health. Studies have shown that obese children face more rejection from their peers and more discrimination from the adults who play significant roles in their lives.  Children who are obese display a greater sense of failure, have limited group and social interests, and experience poorer interpersonal relationships. Physical complications caused by childhood obesity include pediatric hypertension, Type II diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease.  Obesity also increases stress on weight-bearing joints.

<h3>The Treatment of Childhood Obesity:</h3>
<p>
	Weight loss diets are not usually recommended for children. Not only is this approach psychologically stressful, but it may adversely affect growth and the child's perception of normal eating. A child's mental well-being and the integration of healthy eating habits and an exercise routine are more important than pounds lost. Successful behavioral strategies have a positive and significant impact on long-term weight loss in children. The best programs incorporate an exercise component and nutritional training, including teaching children to slow the rate at which they eat, limiting the time and place of eating, and problem-solving exercises. Particularly effective are behaviorally-based treatments that involve parents.

<h2>Parents Can Help Prevent Obesity</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		Obesity is easier to prevent than to treat. Starting in early childhood, teach children about healthy food choices, selecting nutritionally-dense snacks, limiting sugar and high-fat treats, and the importance of exercise.  Discourage too many sedentary activities, such as watching television and playing video games.
	</li>
	<li>
		Make good nutrition and exercise a family affair by planning healthy meals, preparing nutritious snacks, and going to the farmer’s market together.  Go on a family bike ride or walk to the park. This makes the child feel included in a total family effort focused on healthy habits rather than the isolated person with the problem.
	</li>
	<li>
		Encourage children to eat a wide variety of foods in moderation. Teach them about eating “a rainbow” of fruits and vegetables.
	</li>
	<li>
		Help children recognize how their body tells them that they are hungry or full.  Talk about the physical occurrences that accompany each sensation.
	</li>
	<li>
		Do not use food as a reward for accomplishments, compensation for disappointments, or a substitute for love.  Be careful not to bribe children with treats.
	</li>
	<li>
		Do not encourage children to finish everything on their plates when they are truly no longer hungry.
	</li>
	<li>
		Practice what you preach and set a good example for your children.  Remember, your children watch you constantly and learn behaviors by imitating you.  Parents should show their children the importance of regular exercise and having a healthy diet by making each a priority in their own life.
