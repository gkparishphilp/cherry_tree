<h1>STRESS IN CHILDREN</h1>
<p>
	Stress is a feeling of discomfort that is experienced somewhat differently by children and adults and from one individual to another.  Our lives are full of events and situations that result in stress:  marital tension, unemployment, death of a loved one, unexpected bills, serious illness or injury, etc.  For children, stressful occurrences may involve parents’ divorce, failure at school, poverty, pressure from extra-curricular activities (i.e. sports), abuse or neglect or illness.  Even positive events can create a degree of stress, for example, moving to a new home, a career change, a new baby in the family, etc.  Although a certain amount of stress can be healthy, today's busy pace presents most of us with more stress than we want or need, children included.
</p>

<p>
	It is important to know the difference between the "hassles" of daily life and significant stress. Children and parents alike experi¬ence common hassles such as sitting in traffic, standing in lines (at the school cafeteria, at the bank, etc.), changes in daily routine, scheduling conflicts, as well as conflicts with family members or friends.  In general, children (and adults) learn coping strategies to deal with these small hassles.  On the other hand, children and adults are not well equipped to handle significant anxiety, such as a serious illness, death of a loved one, or loss of income. These stressors can result in serious consequences for the emotional and physical well-being of the individual.  However, while daily hassles generally have a smaller and less negative impact on a person’s psyche, the affect of <em>cumulative</em>
	daily "hassles" can be as detrimental as any single traumatic event. The perception of stress is also related to development and experience.  What is stressful for one individual may not amount to even a small hassle for another.  The ability to evaluate stress level and use coping mechanisms improves with age and cognitive development.
</p>
<p>
	The environment in which we live is stressful.  But much of our stress is a result of our mental attitude <em>combined</em>
	with the environment.  For example, something can nearly send you "through the roof" on one day, but on another day the same event may not bother you at all.  This is an example of how our thoughts can affect our mood.  It is not the situation that necessarily causes all the stress. Our beliefs surrounding the event are a large piece of the puzzle.  Fatigue or exhaustion can also play a role in how one perceives and copes with a stressful situation.
</p>

<p>
	Although each individual finds different events more or less stressful, stress in children is usually a result of five major causes:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Fear of failure (academically or socially)</li>
	<li>Unfamiliar, unpredictable, or new situations</li>
	<li>
		Major developmental "hurdles" (moving from middle school to high school, leaving home)
	</li>
	<li>Unclear expectations</li>
	<li>Expectations of something unpleasant (i.e., pain)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Symptoms of Stress</h2>

<P>
	The effects of stress vary among individuals.  Each person may develop unique symptoms and ways of coping with the stress. Some environments (i.e., schools, homes, etc.) are more stressful than others.  Additionally, constitutional factors, such as temperament and gender, play a crucial role in how stress is perceived and handled.  Stress is cumulative and progressive, and coping skills and improved resources are often necessary to reduce its negative impacts.
</p>

<p>
	Generally, there are three identifiable stages of stress marked by phases of physical changes:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Alarm:  During this initial stage, the body goes into "red alert."  Breathing and heart rate increase as the individual considers a course of action.
	</li>
	<li>
		Resistance:  The body attempts to slow down and return to "normal" during this second stage.
	</li>
	<li>
		Exhaustion.  If the stressful event continues, or if the individual is unable to adapt to the situation, exhaustion may follow.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Symptoms of Stress in Children</h2>

<p>
	Symptoms of stress in young children may be difficult to distin¬guish from symptoms of minor illness.  Be on the lookout for signs of fearfulness; irritability; eating, sleeping, or toileting difficulties;  trouble adapting to change in routine; or repeated use of key words such as "afraid" or "sad."  As children mature, their responses to stress often include attention-seeking behaviors, avoidance of certain activities, mood changes, isolation (i.e., the adolescent who disappears into his or her bedroom more and more), changes in quality of school¬work or flat-out refusal to go to school, physical complaints (stomach/headache), and difficulty sleeping.  If you are not able to identify the cause of these symptoms or they persist, seek help for your child from your family physician, school counselor, psychologist, or social worker.
</p>

<p>
	Please take note that children who experience an overwhelming amount of stress may develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  PTSD refers to stress triggered by a specific incident.  That event or incident is severe enough to cause profound damage to an individual's ability to cope in everyday life, especially in those parts of everyday life that remind the person of the traumatic incident.  Parents of children who suffer from PTSD are advised to consult with a qualified professional for a more specific evaluation and treatment to diminish the effects of the incident.

<h2>The Role of a Parent</h2>

<p> <b>Listen</b>
	to your child when he or she describes stressful events or situations. Being a good listener will, first of all, reassure your child that your love and support is available.  Moreover, it will enable you to better understand your role and what you can do to alleviate some of the stress.
</p>

<p> <b>Be aware of "irrational thinking" patterns.</b>
	Sometimes we hear our children say things like "If I don't do this extra assignment, I'll never get into college,” or “I have to get this done or my friends will be angry."  Often, only the initial part of the sentence is stated: "I have to do what the other kids are doing," or, "I need to get this whole list of things finished right now."  Often hidden behind such thoughts and statements is the unfounded belief that "if I don't live up to my teacher's expectations, I'll never be successful," or "if friends get mad at me, then that means I'm not a good person."  And, deep down, these "if...then" statements can mask core beliefs that children accept as true, even if they have never questioned them logically.  If you become aware of harmful beliefs, help your child look at life, and him or herself, more realistically and more positively.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Do not place undue expectations on your child.</b>
	We all want our children to be successful, and we should have expectations for their behavior and performance, but when stress starts to show, it may be time to question whether our expectations are too high.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Teach your child good problem-solving skills.</b>
	The feeling of too much to do in the amount of time available is a frequent cause of stress in children.  When overburdened and overwhelmed, children have difficulty seeing a way out.  Help your child learn to break big problems into smaller ones that can be dealt with one at a time.  Talk with your child about how you have handled stress¬ful situations.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Rehearse stressful situations.</b>
	If speaking in front of a group or making a phone call is causing your child stress, it can be helpful to talk through the event together.  Discuss how he or she wants the event to take place, and then go through the situation together in a "trial run."  Practicing together can help alleviate the stress.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Relaxation/Visualization.</b>
	Teaching your child to sit and take deep breaths while experiencing stress can help him or her calm down and evaluate the situation.  One popular visualization technique is to imagine yourself in a "favorite place" (i.e. somewhere that is warm, peaceful, and comfortable).  For children, as well as adults, exercise can reduce both the physical and emotional burdens of stress.  While these sorts of techniques are useful for diminishing the symptoms of stress, they do little to keep stress from reoccurring.  Some children might even need professional assistance to learn effective relaxation techniques.
