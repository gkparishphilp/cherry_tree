<h1>COHESIVE DISCIPLINE</h1>

<p>
	When the discipline styles of parents have subtle differences it does not drastically affect a child’s behavior.  However, when one parent’s child-rearing style varies significantly from the other's, children are much more likely to act out and have behavior problems.  It is impractical to expect that both parents will think and act exactly in the same manner.  However, when a mother is very strict, and the father is a pushover, for example, children get confused.  It is crucial that parents avoid a power struggle and find a way to discipline children as a united front.

	To create this cohesion between two parents, old habits have to be broken and new strategies on which you both agree must be found.  In order to move forward, you and your mate must have clear and open communication about these strategies. There are several things that can be done to establish a solid discipline partnership:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Discuss how you were disciplined during childhood. Mothers and fathers often repeat the style of discipline used by their own parents.  This conversation will help you understand why your partner uses certain disciplinary methods.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ask yourself why you are opposed to your partner's approach. Find out why this is the way he or she chooses to discipline.  Also, inquire what your spouse dislikes about your style.  Be sure to listen patiently and with an open mind.  If you are not open to your partner’s style and have an “it’s my way, or the highway” attitude, you will position yourself in a power struggle. Instead, try to understand the logic behind your partner's approach.
	</li>
	<li>
		Create a shared set of disciplinary actions (rules and consequences) on which you both agree.  After trying these on your children for two or three weeks, have another conversation to discuss whether they are working for you and your kids, and if any adjustments should be made.
	</li>
	<li>
		At first, you are likely encounter conflict and have disagreements as you implement your new strategy.  Address discipline disputes as they arise, but in privacy where children will not hear.
	</li>

	<li>
		If your partner is frustrated after handling a difficult situation with your children, try to be empathetic and encouraging, even if you don’t exactly agree with his or her disciplinary decision.  Find a moment, away from children, to discuss what happened and be a supportive spouse.
	</li>

	<li>
		Be willing to compromise with your partner, but in the presence of your children, always have a united front. If they observe you working together, they will be less likely to try to play you against each other. It is very important to remember not to speak negatively about your spouse's disciplinary decisions to or in front of your child.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you suspect that your child is trying to play you and your partner against each other, wait to make a disciplinary decision until you can speak with your spouse.  For example, if your son says, "Dad lets me make my bed after I play a little,” tell him you'll give him an answer once you have discussed it with his father. Or, you can say that he needs a "yes" from both parents before he proceeds.
	</li>
	<li>
		If your children can read, list concise rules and consequences in a common area and periodically review them as a family to reinforce the message that you and your spouse are partners. Involving children in the establishment of rules often inspires better cooperation. Have a plan for revisiting rules so they can be adjusted as your kids mature.
	</li>

	<li>
		It is a challenge when your partner refuses to even discuss his or her own style of discipline with you.  You can ask a spouse to write a list of your child's behaviors that make them angry, and the disciplinary methods they would use to deal with the misbehavior.  This will force your partner to acknowledge their actions and may even encourage them to evaluate whether the discipline is appropriate. If all else fails, ask for help from a therapist or counselor, and give your spouse some literature on the topic of discipline.
