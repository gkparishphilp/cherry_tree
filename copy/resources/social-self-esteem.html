<h2>Everything You Need To Know About:</h2>
<h1>BUILDING SELF-ESTEEM</h1>
<p>
	Self-esteem represents how we feel about or value ourselves.  Self-esteem is significant because it gives us self-respect and pride as well as a sense of capability, belonging, and believing that our contributions are valued.  It also creates life skills like resiliency and faith in our ability to handle the challenges life presents.  On the other hand, poor self-esteem has been associated with low academic achievement, susceptibility to peer pressure, delinquency and depression. Although the link between these problems and self-esteem are difficult to establish, many educators believe that self-esteem appears to be a necessary (although not sufficient) condition for successful life adjustment.
</p>
<h2>The Development of Self-Esteem</h2>
<p>
	Beginning around age eight, children not only have a global sense of self-esteem, they also evaluate their capabilities in five areas: (1) physical appearance, (2) social acceptance, (3) scholastic ability, (4) athletic ability, and (5) behavioral conduct.
</p>
<p>
	In some instances, children are able to discount the importance of areas in which they feel less competent.  For example, a child can have a low evaluation of their athletic ability but it will not negatively affect their self-esteem because they have discounted their performance in this area (i.e. "sports are not very important to me"). Low self-esteem results when there is a discrep¬ancy between the importance the child places on an area and his or her perception of competence in that area. A child who sees scholastic achievement as important will have low self-esteem if he or she is doing poorly in read¬ing or math.
</p>
<p>
	Positive regard from significant others, primarily parents, teachers, and peers, is a critical determinant of self-esteem.  Positive regard can be uncondi¬tional, allowing a child to feel love and acceptance regardless of his or her ability or behaviors.  Positive regard can also be conditional, letting a child feel love and acceptance only when he or she meets another person's high standards. Conditional positive regard can shatter a child's self-esteem.

<h2>Characteristics of Children with Low Self-Esteem</h2>
<p>
	The following behaviors may be indicative of low self-esteem:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A reluctance to learn new things or an avoidance of challenge. Children with low self-esteem may have dependency issues and tend to ask parents for help or refuse to do things by themselves.
	</li>
	<li>
		Frequent negative self-statements about self or abilities ("I can't do it" or "I'm no good at that").
	</li>
	<li>
		Excessive criticism of others and/or downplaying the achievements of siblings or peers.
	</li>
	<li>
		Reactivity and dependence on external cues. Children with low self-esteem may be highly sensitive to verbal and nonverbal cues as they search for feedback on their performance. They may react strongly to some cues, such as a frown or sigh from parents, even if assured that the negative cue was unrelated to their performance.
	</li>
	<li>
		Overreaction to time constraints, healthy competition, constructive criticism, or the ups and downs of daily life.
	</li>
	<li>Easily influenced by peers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building Your Child’s Self-Esteem</h2>
<p>
	Here are some strategies to help parents boost their child's self-esteem:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<b>Take a good look at your parenting style.</b>  Parents who are warm, affectionate and accepting often have children with high self-esteem.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Love your child unconditionally.</b>  Be sure to encourage and support your child regardless of his or her abilities, strengths, weaknesses or temperament. Do not make love and support conditional on your child's efforts or behaviors.  If you are displeased or disappointed in a behavior, make sure that your child knows that it is the behavior, not him or her, that is unacceptable.  Tell your child that no matter what, he or she can depend on your love.  Show your child plenty of physical and verbal affection.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Give your child positive feedback.</b>  As often as possible, acknowledge your child’s good behavior and efforts.  Hearing encouragement will help your child’s self-confidence soar because it means that you noticed his or her progress, and not just an achievement.  Be specific about what it was that made you so proud.  Instead of saying, “You were really good today,” try “While we were shopping, you were so patient.”  This will enhance your child's sense of accomplishment.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Give your child undivided attention.</b>  Make the time to focus on your child and give him or her your undivided attention.  This has a significant impact on a child's self-worth by sending the message that you think he or she is valuable.  Giving your child undivided attention doesn’t necessarily mean spending the whole afternoon together.  Rather, it simply means making eye contact (and not looking at your phone or computer) when your child is speaking to you.  Listening attentively, and without judgment, is extremely important in validating your child’s thoughts, opinions, feelings, and desires.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Establish “family time."</b>  On at least a weekly basis spend time together as a family. This, too, conveys the message that your child is a vital part of the family unit.  Decide on a time where the television and phones are off, and the family spends quality time together.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Teach limits by establishing rules.</b>  Your home will be more harmonious if you enforce clear and fair rules, as well as consistent and fair discipline. Knowing that certain family rules are non-negotiable will help your child feel more secure.  Though it may take constant repetition on your part, your child will eventually learn.  If you trust your child and expect him or her to do the right thing, it is likely that he or she will.  Also allow opportunities to discuss disagreements within the family.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Give your child some control.</b>  Let your child make choices during daily activities within prescribed limits. Picking out clothing for school, choosing one meal a week, or selecting the book to be read at bedtime communicates to a child that his or her opinions are trusted and valued.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Be familiar with your child's strengths and weaknesses.</b>  Make reasonable demands for improvement and performance based on your child's abilities, and not based on comparisons with peers, siblings or developmental milestones. Discourage your child from making these same comparisons; they only foster competition, shame and envy.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Encourage your child to take risks and try new things.</b>  Let your children know that you have confidence that he or she can do things independently, even if it forces him or her to take a risk.  Refer to past struggles and point out how your child was able to overcome them ("Remember when you had trouble getting across the monkey bars — you stuck with it and now look how easy it is for you.").  Though failure is always a possibility, success is accomplished by taking risks, so resist the parental instinct to intervene.  Even volunteering to help can foster dependency and reduce your child's confidence.  Failure and “messing up” are valuable lessons for your child's self-confidence.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Model good social problem solving skills.</b> Stress using words to express feelings and discussion as a way to solve family problems. Help your child identify his or her feelings through reflective listening ("you look disappointed about not winning the game.").
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Encourage variety.</b>  It is beneficial for children to develop a wide range of skills and hobbies at which they can feel successful.  Remember that self-esteem is developed through evaluations of ability in multiple areas.
