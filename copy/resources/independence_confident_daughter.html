<h1>Raising a Confident Daughter</h1>
<p>
	As babies and toddlers, girls approach life with enthusiasm and confidence.  Often they reach milestones, such as talking and walking, early. They enjoy group activities and trying new things.  But starting as early as kindergarten, girls begin to encounter a mix of new social and school pressures, lofty parental expectations, and mixed messages from the media and society (e.g., embrace your individuality, but look like this; girls can do anything, but not that).  This confusing blend of outside pressures can cause girls to lose their enthusiasm and can negatively impact girls' self-esteem.

	However, there are many things parents can do to preserve their daughter's self-esteem and confidence.  You should:
</p>

<ol>
	<li> <b>Follow your daughter's lead, not stereotypes.</b>
		Just because your child is a female doesn't mean she’ll despise reptiles, struggle with numbers, or care less about her father’s tool box.  Likewise, don’t assume that she will idolize princesses and fairies or that reading will be her best subject in school.  Let your daughter’s natural gravitation toward certain activities inform you of her preferences and strengths.  Your role will be to help nurture these.  Other cues will reveal her dislikes and weaknesses.  You can work with her to improve these, as well.
	</li>
	<li> <b>Encourage self reliance.</b>
		Do not be too quick to help your daughter with chores, homework or other responsibilities, and certainly refrain from doing them for her.  If she asks you for help with something, encourage her to work through it a little longer on her own before you step in.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Encourage assertiveness.</b>
		Teach your daughter to express her needs to adults and stand her ground with other children. When a peer is mean to her, advise her to calmly but firmly say something like, "It’s not okay to say that to me" or "I don't like what you’re doing."
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Offer sincere praise.</b>
		Children quickly learn the difference between reality and exaggeration.  Avoid telling your daughter that she is the “greatest” or the “best” when she is clearly not.  Instead of saying, “You are the best artist in the world," compliment your daughter’s effort and improvements made over time.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Offer specific praise.</b>
		Compliments have far greater meaning if you use concrete examples.  Your daughter will hear a specific compliment more clearly than a general one. For example, instead of saying, "You’re such a sweet girl," say "You were so nice to share your doll with your friends" or "It was very kind of you to read books to your little brother."
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Encourage participation in sports and other activities.</b>
		Girls have as many athletic options as boys nowadays.  If your daughter wants to play water polo, football, or do ballet, give her a chance to get her feet wet and find out for herself if it’s right for her.  Sports, as well as other activities and clubs, help to build self-confidence, develop a healthy body image, and create an opportunity for positive interaction with peers.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Promote a healthy body image.</b>
		It is great to compliment your daughter’s appearance, but try to compliment her actions, too: "You looked so graceful while you were dancing” or "Your body is so powerful when you swim."  Older girls benefit from hearing that models on television or in magazines do not look like real women.  Explain that their images are often altered to make them look thin and flawless, but in reality, nobody is perfect.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Call attention to strong female role models.</b>
		Show your daughter that girls can do anything by pointing out positive female role models. While watching the news or flipping through magazines, discuss how women are in all kinds of careers and hold leadership positions across the board: politics, law enforcement, medicine, sports, construction, engineering, etc.  If your daughter is exposed to sexism in books, television, or movies, or experiences it in real life, discuss it with her and tell her how females are just capable males.
