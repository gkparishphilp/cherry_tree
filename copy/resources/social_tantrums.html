<h2>Everything You Need To Know About:</h2>
<h1>TANTRUMS</h1>

<p>
	It is common for preschool-aged children to have temper tantrum behavior.  In fact, research suggests that 50-80% of preschoolers demonstrate one or more temper tantrums each week. Temper tantrums range widely from relatively mild behaviors such as whining, pouting, name-calling, and crying to more serious behaviors such as kicking, screaming, biting, scratching, punching, and even self- injurious behaviors like head banging, or even holding one's breath to the point of fainting.

<p>
	Temper tantrum behavior is a normal part of child development.  Typically, tantrums reflect a temporary stopping point along the path of learning how to cope with anger and frustration. For some children, however, temper tantrums become a road block to further maturity and emotional growth. Researchers have found that when a youngster’s tantrum behavior becomes habitual in early childhood, he or she may have adjustment problems later in life.

<p>
	It is rare for children to have temper tantrums when they are alone. Rather, tantrums take place when others are present.  This observation suggests that the answer to effectively dealing with temper tan¬trums lies in how children and their caregivers interact before, during, and after an outburst occurs.

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>
	As their mobility improves, toddlers love to explore and get into things, especially things that their parents have put off limits.  Not only does their mobility improve, toddlers’ ability to comprehend and use words grows quickly, as well.  The expansion of their vocabulary allows them to understand simple commands and begin to express their needs and wants. The combination of these two factors, increased mobility and increased comprehension, leads to an event that toddlers find very frustrating — their parent’s introduction of "verbal rule training."
</p>

<p> <b>Verbal rule training</b>
	is the inundation of do's and don'ts that parents shower on their toddlers in order to keep them out of trouble and protect them from harm.  "Don’t eat that!"  "Don’t throw!"  "Don't touch that!"  "Don't go in there!"  "Don't yell!"  "Do sit down." "Do put that away."  "Do be quiet."  "Do be good."  "Do drink your milk."  And on, and on, every day.
</p>

<p>
	Though infants' coos evolve into words, they never stop using laughter, smiles, cries, and frowns to communicate their feelings and emotions.  Screaming and crying is the familiar method in which a two or three ¬year-old communicates frustration.  The experience of verbal rule training can be very infuriating for toddlers. In response to their frustration, toddlers will often revert to crying and screaming to announce to one and all that they are angry.  An occasional outburst of screams and cries by a two or three-year-old child is quite common and should not cause worry.

<h2>When Should Parents Worry About Tantrums?</h2>

<p>
	The best way to answer this question is to look closely at your child's tantrum behavior as well as you and your family’s behavior when tantrums occur.  Do any of the following statements apply to your family?
</p>
<ul>

	<li>
		Your child throws tantrums in many settings, not just at home.
	</li>
	<li>
		Your child has tantrums regardless of who in the family is caring for him or her.
	</li>
	<li>
		Your child is throwing more and more tantrums each day as time passes.
	</li>
	<li>
		Your child's tantrums are becoming more severe as time passes.
	</li>
	<li>
		Your child hurts him or herself or tries to hurt others during tantrums.
	</li>
	<li>
		Your child receives a great deal of extra attention from family members when a tantrum occurs.  For example, when your child has a tantrum someone hugs or holds the child, or perhaps someone scolds, lectures, or even spanks the child.
	</li>
	<li>
		You or someone in the family tries to stop the tantrum by giving your child what he or she wants.
	</li>
	<li>
		You, or members of your family, avoid taking a tantrum-prone child on outings (i.e. to the grocery store, to restaurants, to church, to visit friends or relatives, etc.) because of fear that the child will throw a tantrum.
	</li>
	<li>
		You find it difficult to get someone to babysit your tantrum-prone child.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If one or more of the items above describes your family’s experience, your child may be developing a severe tantrum problem. This problem could be developing because (1) your child is learning to use tantrums as a tool to get things that he or she needs or wants, (2) your child is modeling tantrum behavior of people he or she sees, (3) your child is responding to delayed language skill development, or (4) your child has a medical disorder.
</p>

<p> <b>Severe Tantrums as a Learned Response:</b>
	The most common way that tantrum behavior becomes a severe problem is when children learn that they can use tantrums to get what they want. When children first develop tantrums, they use crying and screaming as a way of expressing frustration. Tantrums start out as a way for children to communicate that they are "fed up" with rules and the limits placed upon them.  If children learn, however, that throwing a tantrum will get them extra attention from their family or will enable them to do things they were not otherwise allowed to do, their tantrums will come to serve a different purpose. No longer will your child use tantrums simply as a means of expressing frustration. Instead, he or she will use tantrums as a tool for obtaining more attention and getting to have or do more things. Tantrums will have become goal-directed.
</p>

<p>
	Without realizing they are doing so, family members and other caregivers often cause tantrums to become goal-directed.  For example, if a child screams and cries because he or she wants a toy that is out of reach, holding and rocking the child until he or she calms down will soothe the youngster in the moment, but may encourage screaming and crying at a future time when something else is out of reach. Even though the child was not given the toy as a result of his or her tantrum, the child received a great deal of special attention. By repeating this pattern, family members and caregivers actually teach a child to have tantrums to achieve goals. This is not to say that children should never be soothed when they are frustrated and upset. The important point to remember is that children should not be allowed to use tantrums as a way of getting special treatment. Learning to use tantrums as a way to achieve desired goals is by far the most prevalent cause of severe childhood tantrum behavior.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Severe Tantrums that Develop from Modeled Behavior:</b>
	Children who live in an environment where violent behavior is prevalent may model that behavior. A young child, for example, who regu¬larly witnesses screaming and fighting matches between his or her parents may mimic this behavior when he or she becomes upset.  Parents and older siblings serve as powerful models of behavior for youngsters.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Severe Tantrums and Language Delay:</b>
	Another way in which tantrum behavior can become a severe problem is when a child fails to develop age-appropriate language skills.  Children who experi¬ence a history of ear infections and diminished hearing in early childhood, for example, sometimes demonstrate delayed language skill development.  The world is an extremely frustrating place for children who do not possess the ability to understand words well or express themselves clearly with words.  Children with a known history of hearing difficulty and language delay who develop a severe tantrum problem should be evaluated by a speech and language clinician to determine whether language therapy is appropriate.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Severe Tantrums and Other Medical Disorders:</b>
	There are several medical disorders affecting children that may, as a consequence of their symptoms, contribute to the development of severe tantrum behavior. Conditions that broadly impact the development of children such as Autism, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Down Syndrome, Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Seizure Disorder, and Williams Syndrome, among others, may impact children in such a way that the emergence of a severe tantrum problem is likely.  Children who have a medical condition that causes developmental delays and who show signs of severe temper tantrum behavior should be evaluated by an appropriate medical specialist.

<h2>What Can I Do as a Parent?</h2>

<p>
	Whether tantrum behaviors are just beginning to develop in your child, or tantrums have be¬come a long-standing problem, there are actions you and family members can take to help your child gain control over tantrum behavior:
</p>

<p>
	<b>What to Do When Tantrums First Develop:</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li> <em>Rule out a specific cause:</em>
		Make certain there is no possibility that tantrums are being caused by an outside factor other than general frustration with verbal rule training. Some factors which may cause or contribute to tantrums include hunger, exhaustion, illness, teething, side effects from a medication, a sudden emotional loss such as a long absence or death of a loved one, an undiagnosed hearing loss, delayed language skills, or other developmental medical conditions.  In the vast majority of cases, tantrums are the result of frustration encountered in a child’s daily life.
	</li>
	<li> <em>Do not unintentionally reward your child for tantrum behavior:</em> 
		Do not allow your child to receive extra attention from family members or to obtain things they would not otherwise be allowed as a result of throwing a temper tantrum.  Tantrums are not an appropriate way of achieving goals.  Even if what they desire is something your child would normally be allowed to have, do not allow him or her to obtain it by having a tantrum. Provide your child with what he or she wants only when your child is calm and has asked for the item in an appropriate manner.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Examine the routines of your child's life:</em>
		To feel stable and secure, young children need a consistent daily routine.  Being awakened, fed, dressed, bathed, read to, played with, and put to bed at relatively consistent times provide much needed security for your child.  Children who cannot predict when daily events are likely to occur feel uneasy and inse¬cure; therefore, these children express more frustration with their surroundings than children who have a consistent daily routine.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Examine the limits that are placed upon your child's behavior:</em> 
		Either the failure to provide limits on the behavior of a youngster or providing limits that are too severe and strict for a young child's age can wear away security and increase the frustration that a child experiences and expresses. All children need consistent limits on their behavior in order to feel secure, but these limits should be age appropriate.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>
			Scrutinize your own emotional response to the tantrum behavior:
		</em>
		To help a child control tantrum behavior, it is important that you have your own emotions in check. Some tantrum behaviors feed off of the emotional response from caretakers.  Try to remain calm, cool, and collected when your child loses emotional control and throws a tantrum.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>
			Do not scold, shame, or spank your child for having a tantrum:
		</em>
		Scolding or spanking is likely to reinforce tantrum behavior and cause it to get worse.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>
			Do not ignore your child when he or she is behaving appropriately:
		</em>
		Pay extra attention to your child and give them positive feedback when they are behaving appropriately and not throwing a tantrum.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<b>When Tantrums Become a Serious, Long-standing Problem:</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<em>Control your own emotions:</em>
		As mentioned earlier, parents who lose control of their own emotions while dealing with an out-of¬-control youngster demonstrate the very behavior that they want the child to stop. For example, do not yell at your child to get them to stop yelling.  If you find it impossible to keep yourself from becoming upset when your child loses emotional control, obtain support for yourself first.  It will be very difficult for you to help your child if your child is controlling your emotions.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Don't scold or spank:</em>
		Again, you should not scold or spank your child for having a tantrum. Nor should you make them feel ashamed.  Scolding or spanking is likely to reinforce tantrum behavior and cause it to grow worse.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>
			Pay extra attention to your child when he or she is not having tantrums:
		</em>
		By showing your support, offering praise, and making yourself available when your child is behaving well, you teach your child that special attention can be gained by a means other than having tantrums.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Seek professional help:</em>
		If tantrum behaviors have become a severe problem for your child, ar¬range an appointment with a child behavior professional such as your pediatrician, a school psychologist, or clinical child psychologist. A trained child care professional can help you develop a program that will deal with the specific circumstances of your child's situation. Tantrum behaviors that are deeply embedded do not yield to quick-fix solutions. There are effective techniques available for dealing with tantrums that occur at home, in school, and in public areas.  A child behavior professional can help you develop a compre¬hensive plan for dealing with severe tantrum behavior and can demonstrate the special skills you will need in order to help your child get tantrums under control.
