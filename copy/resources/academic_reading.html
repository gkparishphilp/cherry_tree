<h1>DEVELOPING A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD READING</h1>
<p>
	In the classroom, reading instruction typically focuses on specific skills such as vocabulary expansion and sounding-out words. However, the importance of creating positive attitudes about reading is often over¬looked. Children with positive reading attitudes are willing to read, enjoy it, and become readers throughout adulthood. On the other hand, children with negative attitudes toward reading may only read when they are made to, often avoid it, and may even refuse to read altogether.  A child's attitude toward reading may have a profound impact on his or her overall academic development.

	There are many things parents can do to encourage a healthy and positive attitude toward reading in their children.  You should:
</p>
<ol>
	<li> <b>Begin the reading process early.</b>
		It is never too early to start reading to your children.  Even as early as infancy, reading aloud to your children will help them grasp the importance of reading.  You can incorporate books into your children’s bedtime routine to calm and soothe them at night.  By three or four, children who have been exposed to reading can easily sit through a longer picture book, pretend to read themselves, and ask questions about and express interest in story-lines.  By the time they complete their kindergarten year, they are able to do early reading.
	</li>

	<li> <b>Read with and to your children frequently.</b>
		Both younger and older children enjoy listening to stories.  Consider setting aside a "family reading time" on a regular basis.  This will not only encourage positive attitudes toward reading, but also strengthen the family bond.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Provide a variety of reading materials.</b>
		Have books, magazines, newspapers, and reference materials in the home.  By having easy access to reading materials, your children will be more likely to pick up a book on their own, read for pleasure, and search out information.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Choose text that will set your children up for success.</b>
		Parents should not only provide children with a wide variety of material, they must also ensure that the content of that material is appropriate for positively affecting their children’s attitudes toward reading.  In order to set your kids up for success, select texts with subject matters that interests them, but are also challenging.  Be careful not to choose texts that are too advanced and will lead to discouragement, however.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Help your children find the meaning in reading.</b>
		Focus on understanding the reading and the meaning behind the words rather than the mechanics of reading (i.e. pronunciation).  To find the meaning, it is important to ask children questions while they read to help develop their comprehension abilities. Asking children what they hope to discover while reading a book will prompt them to find the purpose of the text and the deeper meaning behind the story.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Give positive feedback.</b>
		Give praise when you see your children reading or when they discuss information from something they read.  Acknowledging your children’s efforts and progress will encourage them to continue.  Children want to please their parents, so your recognition and positive feedback will have a significant influence on their desire to read.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Be a role model.</b>
		Let your child know how much you enjoy reading.  Your enthusiasm and interest in reading a book, newspaper, maga¬zine, etc. will transfer over to them. Observing you read helps your child become aware of the value you place on reading and, in turn, they will place a value on reading as well. Children naturally want to imitate you, so set a good example by frequently picking up a book and having some “quiet time” yourself.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Create a reading environment in your home.</b>
		Because of the many activities that compete for your children’s time and attention (i.e. television, computers, video games, sports, etc.), it may be challenging to create a home environment that supports and instills a love for reading.  However, the effort is worth it and will help contribute to well-rounded, thoughtful, and successful readers.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Visit the library with your children.</b>
		The library is a wondrous place for youngsters and allows them to feel more involved and self-confident when they can select their own reading materials based on their individual interests.
