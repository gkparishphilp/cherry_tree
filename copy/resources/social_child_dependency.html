<h2>Everything You Need To Know About:</h2>
<h1>DEPENDENCY</h1>
<p>Dependency is a problem in children that is often ignored simply because it is less obvious than noncompliance or aggressive behavior. However, dependency issues can interfere with the development of certain skills, such as self-reliance, in children and the self-confidence necessary for decision-making. Social development can also be delayed by dependency, causing children problems in their relationships with adults and other children.</p>
<h2>Development of Childhood Dependency</h2>
<p>Depending on others for needs, such as transportation and food, is normal in childhood. Dependency becomes a concern when the child starts to rely on others to make decisions or perform self-help skills instead of doing it themselves. Dependency is caused by several factors:</p>
<ul>

<li>Overprotective adults who hover over children thwart independence, confidence and self-reliability.</li>
<li>Removing a child’s responsibility by completing tasks or chores for them.  Parents who are busy or working often feel guilty for not spending enough time with their children.  Parents of an ill or injured child may feel the need to compen¬sate for the child's illness. The overcompensations of guilt-ridden adults lead well-intentioned parents to do unnecessary things for their child.  This, in turn, will rob the child’s self-discovery and confidence in their own skills.</li>
<li>Interfering with a child’s independent decision-making and always making choices for the them will discourage children from thinking on their own.</li>
<li>Interfering with problem-solving by interrupting an argument or stepping in when a child is challenged discourages a child’s search for solutions.</li>
<li>Interfering with social development by choosing the child's friends and activities disrupts the child’s decision-making process.
</li></ul>
<h2>Behaviors and Characteristics of Dependent Children</h2>
<p>Dependency varies with the situation and the child. A child may be more dependent in the presence of one parent or teacher than with another. Behaviors which might indicate dependency include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immaturity</li>
<li>Clinging to adults</li>
<li>Indecisiveness</li>
<li>Fear of making mistakes</li>
<li>Withdrawal</li>
<li>Expecting failure</li>
<li>Constantly seeking approval</li>
<li>Lacking self-confidence</li>
<li>Lacking self-respect</li>
<li>Difficulty maintaining relationships with peers</li>
<li>Preferring younger play partners</li>
<li>Avoiding new activities or hesitating to try tasks alone</li>
<li>Depression</li>
</ul>
<p>Dependent children lack enthusiasm. They do not set goals because they feel helpless to control their circumstances. They do not feel that their studying will help them to pass a test. They expect to fail at any new activity, and they are afraid to meet new people. They prefer the safety of not risking failure, so they rely on others to do things for them.</p>

<h2>How Can An Adult Help?</h2>
<p>To help a child with dependency problems you must break familiar habits. It may require you to be less protective and give the child more freedom to prevent smothering the development of indepen¬dence.</p>

	<p><b>Encourage Independence:</b> A child's attempts to manipulate people or situations when they feel uncomfortable should be ignored or promptly managed.  On the other hand, encouragement and praise should be given for any attempt made to complete tasks independently. Give the child opportunities to try new things and meet new people. Let the dependent child know how proud you are of his or her willingness to take these risks.</p>

 	<p>Success will encourage independent efforts while failure will encourage dependency. Provide opportunities for the child to grow in areas that require familiar skills before venturing into more difficult or less familiar areas.</p>
<p><b>Nurture Self-Confidence:</b> Independence is developed one step at a time by a parent’s patient support. Let your child know that you care. Gradually increase the child's independence and responsibility by praising each new effort and encouraging independent decision-making. Your interest in his or her opinions, thoughts, and activities will encourage new efforts. Your confidence in the child's abilities will, in turn, nurture his or her self-confidence and independence.</p>
<p><b>Encourage Decision-Making and Problem Solving:</b>  Begin by giving the child freedom to choose between two acceptable choices. Independent decision-making can be developed through these safe choices. Fear of criticism or failure is removed when both choices are acceptable. For example, show the child two appropriate outfits and ask her to choose which one he or she would like to wear. Gradually extend the choices as the child becomes more confident.</p>

<p>Problem solving is learned through the action of solving problems. Interceding on a child’s behalf hinders this process.  Allow the child to confront all reasonable conflict using his or her own growing resources.</p>

<p><b>Be Consistent:</b> To avoid confusion, rules should be clear to all who play a role in the child’s life. Open communication and clear boundaries will help the child develop confidence in decision-making. Routine, consistency, and follow-through are important, and a consistent plan of action helps the child develop self-reliance.</p>

<p><b>Encourage Self-Reliance:</b> Teaching a child to make a bed, fold clothes, put toys away, or set the table requires time and effort; however, these responsibilities produce confidence and indepen¬dence. The dependent child should be praised for efforts made and for the process of completing the task rather than for the final result alone.  Make sure that responsibilities are age-appropriate.</p>

<p><b>Seek Support from Others:</b>  Dealing with a child’s dependency can be easier when you share ideas and exchange strategies with other parents who relate to your situation.</p>
