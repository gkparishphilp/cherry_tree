<h1>HOUSEHOLD CHORES FOR CHILDREN</h1>
<p>
	When it comes to household chores and your children, it can take more time and effort to super¬vise a child during the chore, or even to get them to cooperate in the first place, than it would take to do it yourself.  A discouraged parent may think it is more trouble than it’s worth and ask, “Why bother?”  However, children actually need chores. The sense of accomplishment they feel after completing household chores plays a very important role in your child’s development.  First and most obvious, chores teach children basic skills for living, such as cleaning and cooking.  Second, they assist in the development of well-trained and efficient helpers over time. Third, chores give parents an opportunity to express appreciation for their children's help in situations that are real and tangible to the child. Lastly, they enable children to develop basic work attitudes and habits such as responsibility, thoroughness, reliability, and persistence. These skills are important not only for housework, but also for school and future employment; they are the building blocks for success as an adult. Chores build a platform for self- confidence, and helps bring the family together as a supportive and cohesive unit.

<h2>Chores and Child Development</h2>

<p>
	Children should begin household chores as soon as they have the motor development to perform easy tasks, usually around three-years-old. In fact, children of this age often want to help and imitate their parents in housework, particularly cleaning duties. Enthusiasm may wane, but it is the parent’s responsibility to gently remind children to perform chores on a regular basis.  The sooner chore habits begin, the more readily the child will accept them as just a natural part of daily life.
</p>
<p>
	In the beginning, chores should involve mutual cooperation between both parents and children. If a task is too challenging, a child will get frustrated and want to quit.  As the child matures in age and reliability, a parent’s direct involvement can be reduced.  Be careful not to underestimate a child’s ability to perform tasks and do them for him or her out of habit.  In general, the progression of chores transfers from simple to complex, and from those focusing on self-care to those contributing to the family as a whole.

<p>
	A child who is <b>3 to 5</b>
	years should be able to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Focus on chores that apply to immediate self-care such as picking up toys, dressing and undressing him or herself, and helping to set or clear the table.
	</li>
	<li>
		Imitate and help parents in other tasks, such as dusting, sweeping, etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	A child who is <b>6 to 8</b>
	should be able to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Establish routines for self-care, such as making their bed every morning, keeping their room tidy, sorting out their own clothes from the clean laundry, and picking up the bathroom.
	</li>
	<li>
		Begin chores that contribute to the family unit, such as feeding pets, setting the table, emptying garbage cans, and pulling weeds.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	A child who is
	<b>9 to 11</b>

<h2>What You Can Do as a Parent</h2>

<p>
	When first assigning a household chore to your child, explain the job, clearly state your expectations, and demonstrate the task. Provide some pointers and, as the task is learned, offer more recognition and support than direction. Even if it is barely adequate, they'll feel more motivation to improve the quality of their work the next time if they feel appreciated for their effort. There are several steps you can take as a parent to achieve success.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Realize that assigning chores is an essential part of parenting. In doing so, you help your child learn that they can make a useful and important contribution to the care and support of their loved ones.
	</li>
	<li>
		Begin by assigning only one or two chores. Choose chores that are relatively simple, and that may be of some interest to the child. Often, children want to help their parents do chores that are beyond their abilities. Even though it may take longer for you to do the task, try to find a way to include the child so that they may begin to develop a sense of contribu¬tion.
	</li>
	<li>
		Select a chore that can be completed daily. This helps your child establish a routine and makes it easier to remember than a chore that is done only once a week.
	</li>
	<li>
		Assign chores so that both sons and daughters have equal opportunity to learn a wide variety of skills. Both sexes need to be familiar with meal preparation, laundry, cleaning, household or car repair, and other "survival skills".
	</li>
	<li>
		Acknowledge your children’s work and effort. Give recognition for both their attempts and for their actual contribution. Point out what has been improved by their effort so that they can begin to develop their own self-appraisal skills.
	</li>
	<li>
		Do not expect your children to remember or volunteer to do chores without prompting. This will only lead to frustration and discouragement for you and your children. Instead, consider ways to gently remind them to do their chores. This might include chore lists and notes (or pictures for younger children) left in common areas, or a regular check-in time each day through the CherryTree.  Let your child report to you (verbally or through a chore chart or through the CherryTree) the work that they have completed so that they feel involved with their chores.  This will help them develop standards for perfor¬mance as well as a sense of accomplishment.
	</li>
	<li>
		Once a chore is assigned, see that it is completed. If you let your children skip it, the importance of the task is diminished in their eyes and also your credibility with them is reduced. Take what¬ever time is needed to provide supervision until the chore is done. Their resis¬tance will reduce over time when they see that you are firm and consistent in your expectations.
	</li>
	<li>
		In general, chores should be completed before playtime. This will help both parents and children feel more relaxed. Some children prefer a break for play or snack before launching into chores or homework. If you agree to this, make it clear when chores will commence.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Should Chores Be Rewarded?</h2>
<p>
	Many parents wonder if they should pair the completion of a chore with an allowance or other reward. This depends on personal beliefs and values. Some parents think that chores are simply contributions to family maintenance, not a "job" completed for payment.  Other parents believe that this pairing teaches children to be responsible, wage-earning adults. Still other parents consider allowance as a means to teach their children money management, and want to keep this separate from chore completion. Any of these approaches can be successful, and there are good reasons to support them all.  Whichever belief you support, it is important that you establish it clearly in your own mind. Then, explain it simply and concisely to your children.
</p>
<p>
	If you do give an allowance, pay or give other awards for chores through the CherryTree, it should always be combined with verbal recognition and acknowledgment of what was accomplished. The relationship between the chore and the reward should also be specified, and always honored. If your child accom¬plishes the chore, the payment should be made, regardless of any other misbehavior that occurs. If the misbehavior is unrelated to the chore, then set a separate consequence for the misbehavior.
</p>

<p>
	Chores offer an excellent opportunity to teach responsibility, introduce family values, and positively strengthen your relationship with your child. A parent’s patience and support can foster self-confidence, competence, and mutual respect with your child.
