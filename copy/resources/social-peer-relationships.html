<h2>Everything You Need To Know About:</h2>
<h1>PEER RELATIONSHIPS</h1>
<p>
	There is plenty of evidence showing the importance of positive social interactions to overall social development.  It is important to know the distinction between "friendship" and "peer acceptance" when discussing children’s peer relationships.  Peer acceptance is having peers who are willing to play with your child.  Friendship is mutual selection as a <em>preferred</em>
	playmate.
</p>

<p>
	Having reciprocal friends may protect against negative outcomes associated with loneliness and low peer acceptance.  Also, friends offer an additional source for companionship, personal guidance, and emotional support outside of the family unit.  Children who experience friendship difficulties, on the other hand, are more likely to experience social maladjust¬ment later in life, including increased levels of aggressive behavior, dropping out of school, employment difficulties, and mental health problems.

<h2>Elements of Friendship</h2>
<ol>

	<li>
		Mutual affection and regard as demonstrated by an exchange of caring and a sense of responsi¬bility for the other
	</li>
	<li>
		Investment of time and attention through shared interests and activities
	</li>
	<li>
		Commitment to the friendship and expectation that it will last across time
	</li>
	<li>Reciprocal loyalty to the other's interests</li>
	<li>Self-disclosure that fosters mutual understanding</li>
	<li>Equality of power in the relationship</li>
</ol>
<p>
	When considering these elements of friendship, it is important to consider age-appropriateness and have realistic expectations.  For example, it is not realistic to expect a four or five-year-old to maintain a lasting friendship.
</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
	Tracking developmental changes in your children’s friendships is important.  Below are some guidelines that may help you understand your children’s friendships at certain ages:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> <b>Preschooler/kindergarten years:</b>
		Young children form friendships based on availability; peers are considered friends simply because they are the only play¬mates around. Children choose playmates who are in physical proximity and who are engaged in a desirable activity. Play episodes are relatively brief with frequent changes in play partners. Common target skills include: building initiative and persistence in seeking play partners.
	</li>

	<li> <b>Early elementary school years:</b>
		Friendship becomes more of an agreement or contract be¬tween playmates, complete with responsibilities and expectations for an exchange of favors and expected duties (birthday parties, sharing treats, unity — as opposed to loyalty). Play episodes are longer, but friendships may not be enduring. Common target skills include: making expectations explicit, keeping one's promise and building negotiation and appeasement skills.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Later elementary school years:</b>
		Expectations become more sophisticated during this age. These include expectations for loyalty, mutual understanding and support. Children of this age spend increasing amounts of time (usually in games and sports) with friends and the influence that peers exert over one another increases proportionally. Common target skills include: recognition of interpersonal obligations, generalization of negotiation skills to middle- childhood interests, conflict resolution skills and recognition of increasingly subtle social cues offered by peers to guide behavior.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Adolescence:</b>
		Friendships no longer center around contracts; rather they increasingly resemble the friendships of adults. Friendship is based on mutuality, intimacy, shared support and loyalty. Common target skills include: building trust and empathy skills to support another's vulnerability that accompanies the sharing of intimate thoughts and personal experiences.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intervention</h2>
<p>
	Parents may find that they need to intervene in their child’s peer relationships in order to cultivate friendships.  Children who are experiencing friendship difficulty may be actively re¬jected or neglected by others.
</p>
<p>
	Children who are rejected by their peers often lack skills like the ability to compromise with others.  They may have a difficult time resolving conflicts or negotiating over disagreements.  They are likely to be more physically aggressive (hits, kicks, pushes, etc.) or relationally aggressive (tells rumors/ lies, excludes others, manipulates friendships, etc.) than their peers. These children often are unable, despite effort, to find playmates on the playground.
</p>

<p>
	On the other hand, neglected children may have difficulty initiating social interactions. They may find it difficult to engage in play even when invited by other children. They often avoid aggression, and are sensitive to teasing and the roughness of other children.
</p>

<p>
	It is important that parents realize that few interventions in their children’s peer relationships are effective in the absence of social interaction in the natural environment. Children need to practice their skills on the playground in social situations with other children. Children naturally correct one another's social errors while in the process of playing and interacting. If a child does not have the opportunity to play with other children and to make social mistakes, little progress can be made toward developing spontaneous generalization of social skills outside intervention groups. Therefore, with the exception of safety issues, it may be more helpful to encourage children to resolve their own arguments and conflicts through problem solving, negotiation and compromise.
</p>

<p>
	However, when your child is having difficulty interacting with his or her peers, one way to monitor his or her social interaction, and to help encourage friendships, is by organizing "playdates,"" or, informal get-togethers.  Here are some suggestions for promoting successful playdates and laying the groundwork for friendship:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Offer a playdate invitation to someone your daughter or son already knows and appears to like.
	</li>
	<li>
		Keep the number of children involved to a minimum.  They should be around the same age as your child.
	</li>
	<li>
		Keep playdates short, between one and two hours long, to avoid over-stimulation or boredom.
	</li>
	<li>
		If the playdate is a success, plan regular get-togethers, weekly if possible, with the same child/children.  Continuity is key to forming lasting friendships and will help familiarize your child with social interaction.
	</li>
	<li>
		Plan the playdate around an activity that your child enjoys to make them feel more confident and comfortable.
	</li>
	<li>
		Get involved with your child’s playdate.  Your presence will put your child at ease, and the children may need you if they run into conflicts or want a change of activity. Oversee activities but refrain from dominating your child’s social time.
	</li>
	<li>
		Be a role model and have playdates yourself.  Since children often imitate their parent’s behavior and follow their parent’s example, ask your own friends to come over for a game of cards or a luncheon, to show your child how positive social interaction looks.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	The important thing to remember is to take small and easy steps without being too overbearing or pushy. The goal of playdates is to create opportunities for rewarding social experiences that will leave your child feeling good and wanting more rather than feeling pressured to do something that is difficult or uncomfortable.
