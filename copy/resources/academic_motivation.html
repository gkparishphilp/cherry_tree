<h2>Everything You Need To Know About:</h2>
<h1>ACADEMIC MOTIVATION</h1>

<h2>Is Your Child Academically Motivated?</h2>
<p>
	A child who demonstrates an interest in learning, gravitates towards learning-related activities, and realizes the importance of school is academically motivated.  Adults should encourage children to develop the desire to succeed in school, and help children understand the significance of learning and how it can enrich their lives.
</p>

<h2>The Development of Academic Motivation</h2>

<p>
	Children are naturally motivated to learn, even as infants.  Child motivation can be witnessed through a babyâ€™s struggle to reach for a toy, repeated attempts to crawl, and his or her determination to walk.  The desire to learn during these early stages is later applied to school and related activities such as reading and writing.  However, when something gets in the way of this natural inclination to learn, children lose academic motivation.  They believe that they cannot do well in school-related tasks, and they either apply little effort or stop trying completely because they think it will be ineffective.  A child gets frustrated easily and quits early when learning becomes difficult.  When they stop trying, children fail to learn successfully. They do not experience the excitement of learning something new, nor gain the confidence that accompanies it.  They believe that any success they achieve is pure luck or circumstance.
</p>
<p>
	Why do some children develop this lack of academic motivation? Often it is a result of things that affect their capability to learn. Learning disabilities, developmental delay, a difficult temperament, depression, or chronic life stress make it challenging for a child to learn in the classroom. Children who have failed in school once are likely to establish a pattern of failure; they simply stop trying to learn and believe that they are unable to do so. The attitudes of adults can also influence children's motivation and their approach to academic success. Parents who have unrealistic standards and unreachable goals set for their children can have a negative impact. Competition in school (where there is always a winner and a loser) can be very discouraging to children, especially individuals who will never be the best: academically, even though they still can learn a lot.  Children who do not experience success, achieve goals, or whose successes are not recognized may develop poor academic motivation. Children whose parents or peers do not recognize the importance of school and fail to encourage children to try their hardest can also develop poor academic motivation.

<h2>Promote a Motivation to Learn</h2>
<p>
	There are many things that parents can do to boost their child's academic motivation. Maintaining good parent-child relationships and talking to your child about the importance of education can heighten academic effort. Teaching your child good study habits and acknowledging his or her successes can also be beneficial. Partnering with your child's teacher may help. Here are more ideas to help you improve your child's motivation to learn:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Teach your child responsibility within the home. Chores and expectations for appropriate behavior are ways to develop self-discipline that can then extend into school and other learning environments.
	</li>
	<li>
		Let your children know that you think learning is important and that is the most significant part of school.
	</li>
	<li>
		Talk with your children about school and show an interest in their teacher, peers and classroom activities.
	</li>
	<li>
		Discuss your own interests and likes with your children, and share what your favorite subject was when you attended school
	</li>
	<li>
		Work diligently to have a good parent-child relationship. Take time to do fun activities with your child. Listen when your child speaks to you, especially about school.
	</li>
	<li>
		Do activities that encourage learning as a family, such as visiting museums, the library, or zoo.
	</li>
	<li>
		Provide opportunities for success. Children who feel a sense of accomplishment are more likely to try new things.
	</li>
	<li>
		Help your children identify things that they enjoy and the areas in which they excel. Capitalize on their interests to build learning experiences. For example, if your child enjoys painting, take him or her to visit an art museum or studio and encourage them to write about their favorite artist.
	</li>
	<li>
		Discuss their career interests and how school will help them reach their career goals.
	</li>
	<li>
		It is critical to praise your children for making a good effort and for succeeding. All children need positive feedback and recognition for a job well done.
	</li>
	<li>
		Balance admiration and criticism when you are helping your child. Too much criticism can be discouraging. Children should know what is expected and receive praise when successful.
	</li>
	However, rewards do not always mean money or special privileges
	<li>
		Simply telling your children that you are proud of them or that you noticed their hard work will be effective.
	</li>
	<li>
		Be fair, but firm when disciplining your child. Children need reasonable boundaries to be responsible and independent.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Incorporate Good Habits that Encourage Learning</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Set a routine for school work. Your child should know when he or she is expected to focus on school work each day.
	</li>
	<li>
		Provide a supportive environment in which your child can do school work.  Set up a place to study where he or she has the necessary supplies and quiet surroundings.
	</li>
	<li>
		Be sure your child finishes all school work at home before moving onto other activities that could be distracting.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work with Your Child's Teacher</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Demonstrate to your child that you respect his or her teacher. Do not address disagreements with the teacher while your child is present.
	</li>
	<li>
		Keep in contact with the teacher so that each of you know what is happening in school and at home.  It is often too late to make changes if you wait until report cards come out.
	</li>
	<li>
		Develop a system to give positive reinforcements at home for hard work at school.
	</li>
	<li>
		Work with your child's teacher to make sure your child learns good study skills.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Addressing Problems with Academic Motivation</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		If your child is already demonstrating a lack of academic motivation, talk with your child about the problem. Is he or she feeling discouraged or confused at school? Are their behavioral needs being met?  Does your child feel that he or she is trying hard to do well?
	</li>
	<li>
		Let your child know that you are supportive and want to help them do better.
	</li>
	<li>
		Identify areas that need improvement by working with your child's teacher.
	</li>
	<li>
		Recognize the things in which your child succeeds and give praise so that the focus is not only on areas of difficulty.
	</li>
	<li>
		Find things that resonate with your child and use them to help with school work (for example, if a child is interested in animals, read books and write stories about animals, make up math problems using animals, etc.).
	</li>
	<li>
		Reward effort and productivity, not necessarily with money, but with applause.
	</li>
	<li>
		Increase the amount of time your child studies each day by small increments (five or ten minutes) until you reach a reasonable goal (such as an additional thirty minutes per day).
	</li>
	<li>
		Limit things that distract from learning and school work, such as television, video games, computer time, etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>If Necessary, Find Additional Help</h2>

<p>
	Talk with your child's teacher, school counselor, or school psychologist and ask for guidance.  If there is reason to suspect a learning disability, request a comprehensive assessment from your school's special education team.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		There are often parent or PTA groups that can assist you and provide support.
	</li>
	<li>
		Find out if tutoring or instruction in study skills is available at your child's school.
	</li>
	<li>
		Don't be afraid to seek parental guidance or counseling outside of the school if necessary.
	</li>
</ul>
