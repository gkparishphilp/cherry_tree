<h1>TABLE MANNERS</h1>

<p>
	Parents often wonder where to begin when it comes to teaching their children better table manners. Once your child is in grade-school, start with the ideas that mealtime should be pleasant and that good behavior makes meals even more fun for the entire family. Discuss the importance of good manners with your child, and encourage him or her to think of him/herself as a polite person. Be a good example for your child by using good manners yourself and then set realistic expectations for your child.  Gently enforce those expectations until good manners come naturally.

<p> <b>What manners can I teach my child?</b>
</p>

<p>
	Once your child is grade-school age, they are capable of having "basic" manners, plus a few that are a little more fine-tuned.  Your child should know to wash his or her hands before coming to the table, and that books and toys should be left behind.  Expect your child to sit up properly at the table with his or her feet below and not in the chair.  Tipping the chair back should not be allowed either.  Your child should say "please" and "thank you" at the dinner table and know to use utensils instead of fingers when appropriate.  When your grade-schooler is finished eating, he or she should ask to be excused and should take his or her dishes to the kitchen counter or sink.

<p>
	Remember to tell your child that he or she is now old enough to learn some adult table manners, as well.  Some of the finer points you may want to teach include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Waiting until everyone at the table is served before beginning to eat
	</li>
	<li>
		Putting your napkin in your lap and using it only to wipe your mouth
	</li>
	<li>
		Complimenting the foods you like (and remaining silent about the foods you dislike)
	</li>
	<li>Taking small bites and chewing with a closed mouth</li>
	<li>Trying not to slurp</li>
	<li>Properly using a fork and knife to cut food</li>
</ul>
<p>
The most important thing you can teach your child at the table, however, is good communication skills.  Teach your child to speak pleasantly (with an empty mouth).  Including your child in table talk gives him or her practice with social communication skills and shows that you feel your child is an important part of the family.</p>


<p><b>What is the most effective way to teach my child these manners?</b></p>

<p>Your child views you as a role model, so the best way to teach manners is by setting a good example.  Demonstrate good manners yourself by talking pleasantly at the table; this means no raised voices, no complaining, no lectures, and no arguments.  Use your "please's" and "thank you's" when you would like something passed your way.  Compliment the chef and put your napkin in your lap.  Remember not to talk on the phone, read the paper, watch television, or continue to get up and down throughout the meal. Show your child the same common courtesy that you expect from your child.  Tell your child that proper table manners include showing respect for the other people at the table.</p>

<p>Consistency is important.  When you introduce a new behavior, set expectations by stating them clearly and use gentle reminders to reinforce them.  Prompt a "thank you" when you refill your child's glass, or hand you child a fork if he or she is using fingers to pick up spaghetti.</p>

<p>Be sure to compliment your child when he or she behaves well at the table.  If he or she sits quietly while waiting to be served or asks to be passed something in a polite manner, recognize the effort.  However, you do not want your child be the center of attention when you sit down to a meal, so be careful not to overdo the praise.</p>

<p>You might also want to explain to your children that using manners and knowing the polite thing to do will make him or her feel more comfortable in all kinds of situations.  Explain, for example, that he or she will be expected to sit properly at the table while eating at a friend's house, say "thank you" while dining with relatives, and use silverware correctly in a nice restaurant.</p>

<p><b>What should I do when my child misbehaves at the table?</b>
Natural consequences are best. Until your child asks politely, refrain from giving him or her another helping of pasta. If your child is goofing-off and acting in an unpleasant fashion, tell him or her to leave the table.  If you make an effort to make mealtime enjoyable for your child, for example by engaging him or her in conversation and having a positive attitude yourself, then your child will be more likely to want to stay and partake in this "together time."  Hopefully, during the next meal, he or she will refrain from the type of behavior that leads to exile.  </p>

<p><b>Once your child is in grade-school, what are some good rules?</b>
It is okay for different families to have different rules.  You should decide which rules are most important for your family. For example, one family may not allow elbows on the table, while another may not care.  Another family might feel it is perfectly acceptable for everyone to come to dinner in pajamas and bare feet, while another may feel that clothing and shoes are mandatory. </p>

<p>You will want to be certain that your child learns polite behavior, but there is some give and take on what that means. Teach your child good manner "basics" and even some of the fine points if you want, but try not to get too caught up in formalities.  After all, good manners are really about being respectful and considerate of others. If your child remembers that, he or she will do just fine.</p>

<p>Whichever rules you decide to enforce, you may want to steer clear of the traditional "clean your plate" rule.  It is healthier for your child to stop eating when his or her body signals fullness than to finish a portion that someone else has served up.  Instead, offer small helpings, refilling as needed, and respect your child's decision to stop eating.</p>

<p>The traditional "sit at the table until everyone has finished" rule may be another to avoid, at least in some circumstances.  When your child reaches grade-school, he or she will be better able to wait patiently for all family members to finish eating, however, you still may not want to require this at every meal.  If your grade-schooler has finished eating, but the rest of the family is engaged in a lengthy discussion about the presidential debate, there is no reason to make him or her stay.  In a situation like this, let your grade-schooler ask to be excused.</p>

<p><b>What can I do to get my grade-schooler to behave in restaurants?</b>
It will be very helpful if your child has been learning table manners at home already.  Before you enter the restaurant, discuss with your child your expectations for his or her behavior once you are inside.  Explain that there will be other people in the restaurant who will not enjoy being disturbed, so your child will have to use proper table manners and a soft "inside voice."</p> 

<p>Make it easy on your child (and yourself) by selecting an appropriate, kid-friendly restaurant that serves food somewhat quickly and is not overly crowded.  You may even find that it is helpful to call your order in before you leave the house.  Be certain your child is well rested when you take him or her out to eat.  It is helpful if your child is hungry, but not so hungry as to trigger a tantrum.  While you are seated, practice reading the menu together.  Compliment your child's patience and good behavior.  If your child drops a utensil, instruct him or her to leave it on the floor and help him or her politely ask the waiter for another.  If the waiter refills your child's water glass, make sure your child says "thank you."</p>

<p>It is likely that your grade-schooler will enjoy the experience of going out to a restaurant. If he or she is not up to the task once you are there, however, do not reprimand in public.  Simply provide gentle reminders about your expectations for good manners and behavior.  If your child is disturbing others, leave without making the scene even bigger.  Explain to your child that you had to leave the restaurant because his or her behavior was unacceptable.  Help your child make the connection that behaving properly means that he or she will get to do more fun things.</p>

<p>Role-play at home is another way to practice appropriate restaurant manners.  For example, host a pretend tea party or play restaurant with your child and ask him or her to teach good manners to the attending dolls and teddy bears.</p>  

<p>Remember to always be positive, patient, and complimentary while teaching and enforcing manners.  Not only are you adding positive structure to your child's daily routine, but you are helping develop your child's social skills, as well.  Learning manners has life-long benefits, so your patience and persistence is worth the effort!</p>
