<h2>Everything You Need To Know About:</h2>
<h1>SPORTS</h1>
<p>
	Organized sports can enrich children in many different areas, including self-esteem, discipline, motivation, and goal setting.  Exercise and a healthier lifestyle are obvious benefits, but your child’s involvement in athletics teaches valuable lessons in social skills, as well.   More important than just the participation in the sport, however, is the "context" of the sport.  The type of child, the type of team, and the type of coaching style are all significant factors that can impact the athletic experience.  If the match among these three factors is not positive, then benefits may be minimal.  However, if the match is right, then sports can enhance physical and psychological health. Understanding and appreciating these factors is an important task for parents.

<h2>Insuring Benefits from Sports</h2>

<p>
	Experts agree that most, if not all, areas of your child's development can benefit from organized sports.  The more evident benefits include an elevated self-esteem, individual skill development, health-consciousness, and greater physical fitness. Less obvious benefits include the development of teamwork, group cooperation, and friendship-building social skills. Some skeptics criticize children's sports programs and suggest that participation in sports is hazardous to a child's physical and emotional health while blaming them for causing undue stress, decreased self-esteem, burn-out and even psychological trauma, in some instances. However, sports participation is neither good nor bad. Rather, it is depen¬dent upon the context in which it occurs.  It is the parent’s responsibility to understand this context.
</p>

<p>
	There are several important factors to consider regarding children's participation in organized sports.  These include the personality and family dynamics of the child, the way in which the competitive situation is structured, and the organizational/managerial style of the coach.   Understanding each of these aspects will enable parents to make informed decisions about their child's participation in sports and ensure that the experi¬ence is a positive one.

<h2>Your Child as an Athlete</h2>
<p>
	As children mature, they naturally seek to define their role in society while refining their sense of individuality.  To do this, children want to know where they stand in comparison to others.  Sports become a social process within which they can make these comparisons.
</p>

<p>
	Children, like adults, vary in the way they cope with success and failure. Those who cope well take success in stride, but they also manage disappointment and failure without undue harm to their self-confidence. Others tend to personalize failure and take longer to recover from new disappointments, like losing a game or not making a team.  Understanding your child's self-esteem and coping abilities is important, not only to assist in matching him or her with the right type of team and coach, but also to help you monitor your expectations for your child's performance. Expectations that exceed a child's performance potential can exert inordinate pressure on children with poorer coping skills, leading to a loss of self-confidence.
</p>
<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>
	Teams that are instructional by design are for young children (usually under eight-years-old, though it varies from league to league) with entry-level athletic ability. These leagues provide many accommodations for the younger player, for example, no league standings, no scores kept during "games," no ongoing instruction and feedback during games, with parents usually serving as volunteer referees.
</p>
<p>
	Community recreation leagues typically assign all children to teams, regardless of their individual skill levels, and therefore avoid children’s fear of rejection, or "being cut."  Recreation leagues also mandate minimum playing times for each of their players.
</p>

<p>
	As children get older, they may participate in more competitive teams and leagues.  For example, "traveling" or "all-star" teams place a great emphasis on winning and choose only the best players from the tryout pool. Only the most skillful players of these teams see substantial playing time, with the rest spend¬ing much of their time on the bench.  Children who dislike intense or competitive situations may not thrive on this type of team.
</p>

<h2>The Coach</h2>
<p>
	As the competitive nature of teams increases, so do the weekly practice hours, making the child's coach almost as prominent a figure in the child's life as his or her classroom teacher.  It is therefore beneficial for parents to find out as much information about a coach before their child is a part of the team.  Consid¬ering the influence that a coach can have on his or her players, it is not unreasonable to suggest that parents ask around about a coach as much as they ask around about their child's new teacher.
</p>
<p>
	A child's coach should know the sport well enough to teach it in well organized and structured practices.  A good coach should never admonish or belittle a player, nor lose control of his or her emotions in front of a player.   A coach should have good communication skills with both children and parents.  Lastly, a coach must know how to give feedback to a child in the appropriate manner; it is the difference between motivation or discouragement.

<h2>Suggestions for Parents</h2>
<ol>
	<li> <b>Choose a sport that matches your child's interest and personality.</b> 
		Does your child show an interest in a particular sport?  Is your child outgoing and social and well-suited for a team sport, or the shy, quiet type who would benefit more from solitary sports, like swimming or running?  Does your child enjoy structure and organization, or does your child prefer to set his or her own pace and routines?
	</li>
	<li> <b>Choose a team that matches your child's skill level.</b>
		Is the team more instructional or competitive?  Will players be assigned to teams with other players of similar skill level? Is there a playing time requirement?
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Check the level of commitment expected.</b>
		How long is a season?  How many hours of practice per week?  Keep in mind that children should be free to pursue different sports experiences.  Coaches should not expect young children to "specialize" in one sport.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Listen to your child.</b>
		If your loses interest in a particular sport, allow him or her to give it up at the end of the season.  However, investigate the reasons for this change of heart.  Is it based on social problems among team members, a difficult coach, or a true lack of interest in the sport?
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Make sure your child maintains a balance in his or her life.</b>
		Encourage other interests: art, choir, etc.  Do not allow sports to be every¬thing.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Help your child feel more confident about his/her skill level.</b> 
		If your child is self-conscious about his or her skill level, work with your child privately if possible.  Acquiring these skills will help build self-esteem and enhance effort in the future.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>
			Praise effort, not outcome (winning), and encourage progress.
		</b>
		Avoid comparing one child's performance to another. Rather, focus on personal effort and improvement (i.e. "It looks like you’re able to kick the ball so much further lately.")
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Monitor your child's stress level during the season.</b>
		If your child appears to be overwhelmed, physically or emotionally, step in and figure out a plan of action to reduce stress.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Communicate with the coach.</b>
		If concerns that you raise with the coach fall on deaf ears, identify another person in the league whom you can call to further discuss the matter.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>
			Monitor your own expectations of your child's athletic performance.
		</b>
		Losing should not bother you more than it bothers your child.  Remember that the benefits of participating in sports do not hinge on winning or losing.
