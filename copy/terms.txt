other information that may be mentioned on the Site. Reliance on any

<p ><b><u>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accounts,
Passwords and Payments.</u></b></p>

<p >A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Account

within their Account can view their child(ren)Õs progress on the Site. Only the
Parent may add their child to an Account.</p>

<p >&nbsp;</p>

<p >B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Passwords
and Account Access</u></b>. You are responsible for maintaining the
confidentiality of your password and Account information. You agree that: (a)
you will provide accurate registration information about yourself and any
individual you authorize to access your Account and keep your Account
information up-to-date; and (b) each Account administrator is solely
responsible for all activities that occur under his/her Account. You agree to
notify us immediately of any unauthorized Account use. We are in no way
responsible for any loss that you may incur as a result of any unauthorized use
of your Account and password. You will not sell, transfer, or assign your
Account or any Account rights.</p>

<p >&nbsp;</p>

<p >C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Account
Fees</u>. For certain types of Accounts, we may charge a fee, such as a
membership fee or subscription fee. We may change any fee or charge at any time
in our discretion. All fees and charges are payable in accordance with payment

offered for sale through the Site. If we do not receive payment from your credit

at that time, for the duration of the Account subscription you have selected.

date. We will charge your credit card (or the other method of payment initially
used by you) each year, month or other applicable period (depending on the term
that you selected) for the then-current applicable price.</p>

<p  style='text-indent:.5in'>(iii) <b><u>Subscription
Cancellation</u></b>. To avoid future billing you may cancel your Account to
TheCherryTree.com prior to its renewal date through the Settings area in the
Parents Section. You will continue to have access to your Account for the
period of time that has already been prepaid, calculated based on the
non-promotional/non-discounted rate in effect at the time of cancellation. An

<p >&nbsp;</p>

<p ><b><u>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Governing
Law, Arbitration, Injunctive Relief and No Class Actions.</u></b></p>

<p >&nbsp;</p>

<p >A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Governing
Law/Jurisdiction</u></b>. THESE TERMS, AND ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, WILL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.</p>

<p >&nbsp;</p>

<p >B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Arbitration</u></b>.
If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Site
or these Terms (collectively, &quot;Dispute&quot;), the Dispute will be
resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then current
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
(&quot;AAA&quot;). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single
neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer, who will administer the
proceedings in accordance with the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
Related Disputes. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions
of these Terms, and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according
to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and
will issue a reasoned award. If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA
for arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within
sixty (60) days of the filing of a &quot;demand for arbitration,&quot; then
either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial
Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;) and determined by a
single neutral arbitrator who is a lawyer or a retired judge, using JAMS'
Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration
service to which you and we consent. You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures,
rules, and fee information as follows:</p>

<p >&nbsp;</p>

<p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Nature,
Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution</u></b>. In
arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator will resolve the submitted Dispute
and can issue an award consistent with this Section 7. However, WITH
ARBITRATION THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND
ARBITRATION IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND JUDICIAL REVIEW OF
THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. All parties to the arbitration will have
the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other
advocate of their choosing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required,
then it will be conducted in the &quot;metropolitan statistical area&quot; (as
defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute
is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and
arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration
rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require us to pay a greater
portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 7 to be
enforceable, then we will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and
proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable
arbitration rules. The arbitrator's decision must consist of a written
statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must
provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the
decision and any award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and
award (if any) may be entered into any court that has jurisdiction over the
parties.</p>

<p >&nbsp;</p>

<p  style='text-indent:.5in'>(ii) <b><u>Small Claims Matters Are
Excluded</u></b>. Either of us may bring a qualifying claim of Disputes in
small claims court.</p>

<p >&nbsp;</p>

<p >C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Injunctive
Relief</u></b>. The foregoing provisions of this Section 7 will not apply to
any legal action taken by us to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in
connection with any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or
damage) relating to the Site, any Content, and/or our intellectual property
rights (including any we may claim that may be in dispute), operations, and/or
products or services.</p>

<p >&nbsp;</p>

<p >D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>No
Class Actions</u></b>. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis
and will not be consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings
that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.</p>
